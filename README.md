# My Portfolio

I have used React and Tailwind CSS to create my portfolio site.

To get started with the project, simply clone the repo and then open your code editor and run the command `npm install` to install the packages. Then, run the command `npm start`
to run the app in development mode. It will open http://localhost:3000 to view the website in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

You can view the site on http://gfaizank.netlify.app/
