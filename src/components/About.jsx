        building performant and scalable webapps. i also love crafting beautiful
        interactions and animations on web using framer-motion. i'm also
        exploring AI these days.
        <br />
        <br />
        i love building projects and exploring different sides of tech. most of
        my nights are spent in googling things i've never heard about or working
        on a cool idea. <br />
        <br />
        i've previously worked with inzint, urban space and amazon where i spent 3.5 years in building
        interactive web apps and scaling them. For the Last few months i've been working with a Stealth Startup in AI space
        where i spent most of my time in building new AI
        based web apps that don't exist in the aviation ecosystem yet.
        <br />
        <br />
        i've also worked with various startups like web rats and a leading edtech based company in my
        university days. in my uni days, i've worked in multiple domains like
        web3, entertainment, and e-commerce and helped them build dashboards and
        hero pages.
